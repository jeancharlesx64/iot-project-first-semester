Project developed in the 1st Semester of SPTech Scool, is a project that must be integrated with IoT. We must look for a relevant problem with high social/economic impact, and the solution must be simple and efficient, based on the simulation using Arduino, we must build an embedded project using one of the sensors below to build the solution to the defined problem:

- Temperature sensor;
- Humidity sensor;
- Lock sensor;
- Brightness sensor.

Only these must be used, no more, and must take as premises that it is a SIMULATION, yes, a simulation, not necessarily the sensors will be industrial level, you can check the repository documentation about the electronic components involved [here](https://github.com/jeancharlesx64/base-sensor-script). The solution must use a maximum of 2 sensors and a minimum of 1 sensor, this is a rule to be followed by all teams involved.

The Teams must have as requirements some "deliverables", these are tasks that must be mandatory to be demanded in each Sprint(1 semester, there are 3 sprints, these are short periods in which fragments of a project are presented, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3), which will then be presented and analyzed by the Research and Innovation advisor professor.

#### 10th Group
We are group 10, a team made up of 6 members:
- Jean Charles | @jeancharlesx64
- Pedro Miguel | @spedro-miguel
- Isabella Matos | @IsabellaMatos44801
- Isaque Borges | @IsaqueBorges01
- Kaique Sotero | @kaiquetozim
- Marcelo Alves | @171marcelo

<h3 align="center">Problem found - Lack of temperature and humidity management in corn storage</h3>

Failure to properly manage temperature and humidity in corn storage can result in a number of significant problems. Corn is a sensitive product that can be easily affected by adverse environmental conditions. Here are some of the consequences of lack of temperature and humidity control:

- **Quality degradation:** Excessive moisture can lead to the proliferation of fungi and bacteria, resulting in mold, fermentation and rotting of corn. This not only compromises the quality of the product, but can also make it unsuitable for human or animal consumption.

- **Weight loss and nutritional value:** Improper storage conditions can lead to loss of moisture in corn, resulting in weight loss and decreased nutritional value. This can negatively affect profitability for farmers and the quality of animal feed.

- **Risks to animal and human health:** Corn contaminated by mycotoxins, which are by-products of fungi present in conditions of high humidity, can pose serious risks to animal and human health if consumed. Mycotoxins can cause serious illness and even be fatal in animals and humans.

- **Economic waste:** Corn spoilage due to lack of temperature and humidity control results in economic waste for farmers and the food industry as a whole. This includes additional costs of disposing of damaged products and lost profit potential.

There are numerous problems that were found by team 10, which affect society and the general economy, as **10% of corn production** is lost due to lack of management due to corn production.

<h3 align="center">Solution</h3>
The solution defined by the group is to create a simulative prototype of a device that will constantly monitor temperature (and humidity with the temperature sensors (DHT11) and humidity with the Arduino Uno, where this data will be sent via API to a Node server running on Cloud, where data will travel to a Web platform where only our application client can have access and thus be able to make a definitive decision for their business

We chose the name GuardTech+ which references monitoring technology with the + signifying Plus, but also, in Portuguese representing the word "Mais", which in some countries is what corn is called, as in French, Spanish, Italian and other languages. We decided to use a simple logo representing corn, with a simple minimalist font and color with the slogan "Sempre Mais com vocÃª" ("Always more with you") with this pun suggesting that producers should no longer lose their corn in storage using our solution.
