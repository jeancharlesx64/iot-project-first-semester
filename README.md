Project developed in the 1st Semester of SPTech Scool, is a project that must be integrated with IoT. We must look for a relevant problem with high social/economic impact, and the solution must be simple and efficient, based on the simulation using Arduino, we must build an embedded project using one of the sensors below to build the solution to the defined problem:

- Temperature sensor;
- Humidity sensor;
- Lock sensor;
- Brightness sensor.

Only these must be used, no more, and must take as premises that it is a SIMULATION, yes, a simulation, not necessarily the sensors will be industrial level, you can check the repository documentation about the electronic components involved [here](https://github.com/jeancharlesx64/base-sensor-script). The solution must use a maximum of 2 sensors and a minimum of 1 sensor, this is a rule to be followed by all teams involved.
